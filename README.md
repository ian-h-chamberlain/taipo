# taipo (working name)

Taipo is an experimental game exploring the idea of limiting control of the game to typing random Japanese phrases.

This could turn out to be a useful tool to practice quick Japanese recognition / production.

Currently targeting webgl only, but there's no reason we couldn't do native desktop builds too.
